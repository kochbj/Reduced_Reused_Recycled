# Reduced, Reused, and Recycled: The Life of a Machine Learning Dataset
## NeurIPS 2021
### Best Paper NeurIPS Datasets and Benchmarks Track
This repository contains the [datasheet](Datasheet_for_ReducedReusedRecycled.pdf), data, and code to reproduce all the analyses in the paper.
I'm stil organizing things a bit, but if you need something immediately or find it confusing, please open a GitHub issue or email me. I recommend reading the paper, appendix, and datasheet (in that order) thoroughly before sifting through the code.
